## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will this load Google Fonts automatically?

Yes, if you check the option to load fonts automatically. Otherwise each font set must be manually triggered.

### Is it Legal to Self-Host Google Fonts?

Yes. The open source fonts from Google Fonts are published under a licenses that allow you to use them on any website, no matter if itâ€™s commercial or personal.

### How to check if my site is loading Google Fonts?

It's easy to check if your site is loading fonts from a third party source (check [2nd screenshot](https://wordpress.org/plugins/local-google-fonts/#screenshots) above):

1. Open the dev tools (Cmd + Opt + I on Mac or F12, or Ctrl + Shift + I on Windows)
2. Go to the **Network** tab and select the **Fonts** type
3. Reload your page to see all fonts loaded on your site.
4. Check the **Domain** column if it contains domains from a third party (Google is fonts.gstatic.com)

If you host your fonts locally with [Local Google Fonts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/local-google-fonts/) there should be no fonts loaded from the Google servers.

### My fonts do not show up on the settings page, what can I do?

Fonts are discovered once they are used. Try to browse your front end first and get back to the settings page.

### My fonts are not replaced, what can I do?

The plugin currently only checks fonts embedded via [`wp_enqueue_style`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_style/) if you use Google fonts via `@import` you have to change that first.

### The Divi theme still loads a Google font?

The Divi theme has a custom implementation of Google Fonts. To use LGF with Divi disable _Improve Google Fonts Loading_ on the Performance Settings page of Divi.

### Why are some characters displayed in the fallback font?

You may have loaded a subset which doesn't included required characters. Check additional subsets on the settings page and reload your font.
