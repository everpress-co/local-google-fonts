## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will this load Google Fonts automatically?

Yes, if you check the option to load fonts automatically. Otherwise each font set must be manually triggered.

### Is it Legal to Self-Host Google Fonts?

Yes. The open source fonts from Google Fonts are published under a licenses that allow you to use them on any website, no matter if itâ€™s commercial or personal.

### How to check if my site is loading Google Fonts?

It's easy to check if your site is loading fonts from a third party source (check [2nd screenshot](https://wordpress.org/plugins/local-google-fonts/#screenshots) above):

1. Open the dev tools (Cmd + Opt + I on Mac or F12, or Ctrl + Shift + I on Windows)
2. Go to the **Network** tab and select the **Fonts** type
3. Reload your page to see all fonts loaded on your site.
4. Check the **Domain** column if it contains domains from a third party (Google is fonts.gstatic.com)

If you host your fonts locally with [Local Google Fonts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/local-google-fonts/) there should be no fonts loaded from the Google servers.

### My fonts do not show up on the settings page, what can I do?

Fonts are discovered once they are used. Try to browse your front end first and get back to the settings page.

### My fonts are not replaced, what can I do?

The plugin currently only checks fonts embedded via [`wp_enqueue_style`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_style/) if you use Google fonts via `@import` you have to change that first.

### The Divi theme still loads a Google font?

The DIVI theme has a custom implementation of Google Fonts. To use LGF with DIVI disable _Improve Google Fonts Loading_ on the Performance Settings page of DIVI.

### Why only the woff2 font format is loaded?

Woff2 is the successor of the woff format and and offers a 30% average compression gain over the original format. It is also supported by over 96% of browsers ([source](https://caniuse.com/woff2)).

### How to host Fonts loaded with Slider Revolution?

Slider Revolution uses it's own way to load Google Fonts and LGF cannot handle them. Slider Revolution has a built in feature for their sliders.

1. Goto Slider Revolution
2. Click on "Global" in the top navigation
3. Find the "Fonts" section and Choose "Cache Fonts Local" on "Enable Google Fonts download"
4. Save your settings.

### Why are some characters displayed in the fallback font?

You may have loaded a subset which doesn't included required characters. Check additional subsets on the settings page and reload your font.
